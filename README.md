# Gait-Detection

In this project for detect gait and non-gait signal from the IMU data using machine learning.
When the participant walk consist of gait signal, and non-gait signal when the participant don't move, for example sleeping, sitting, etc.

Through this project:
- you can understand how to preprocess IMU data.
- Prepare data for machine learning
- Extract features from the IMU data
- Train and test the extracted features with machine learning
- And also predict the real data from the raw of IMU sensor.


Thank you for reach out this toturial, I hope this small project could help you through the concept of preparing IMU data for machine learning, how to classify the gait and non-gait data using machine learning, and more.
